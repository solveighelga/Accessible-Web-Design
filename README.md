# Accessible-Web-Design
### I found researching this guide very interesting and spent a lot of time watching and reading about Accessible web design.
### I used a chrome plug in WAVE to help me evaluate my website according to the accessibility rules. I also used my built in MAC VoiceOver to see how my page would be read.
### More on what I did I commented in my code :)
